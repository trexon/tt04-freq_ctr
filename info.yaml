# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  how_it_works: |
      "A simple frequency counter that should work up to close to clock frequency/2 with an 8-digit LED display 7-segment drive"

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
     "Connect an 8-digit common anode LED display to the digit drive and sev_segment ports. Both are active low drive so 
     PNP transistors or P-channel MOSFETs are required to drive each digit (max 8) 
     Apply a clock, ideally 50MHz, but if TT4 can't support that, then 10MHz, input n10_50 selects (low for 10MHz clock, high for 50MHz)
     Apply a signal to be measured and the multiplexed display should show the frequency "

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - input signal
